Student Project Ideas :sparkles:

A place for FAC20 to document ideas and thoughts for student projects (Weeks 11 - 13). 

## Contributing

Every member of FAC20 is encouraged to contribute an issue, although you are not required to.

Please contribute by opening an issue and using the 'Student Project Idea' template.

We're looking for **problems, not solutions**, so even if you do have an idea in mind about how to solve this, you should explore how to solve this issue as a team once projects have been selected.

You can contribute more than one issue if you like.
