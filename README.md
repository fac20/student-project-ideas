# Student Project Ideas :sparkles:

A place for FAC20 to document ideas and thoughts for student projects (Weeks 11 - 13). 

## Contributing

Every member of FAC20 is encouraged to contribute an issue, although you are not required to.

Please contribute by opening an issue and using the 'Student Project Idea' template.

We're looking for **problems, not solutions**, so even if you do have an idea in mind about how to solve this, you should explore how to solve this issue as a team once projects have been selected.

You can contribute more than one issue if you like.

Before reading week (and depending on how many ideas are submitted), we will take 90-120 seconds for each issue to be introduced by the person who wrote it, so everyone understands the starting point for each potential project. Everyone is then encouraged to react to and leave comments on whichever issues spark some interest.
